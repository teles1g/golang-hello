## Golang

![go](https://github.com/teles1g/golang-hello/blob/main/golang.png)

Go is a programming language created by Google and released as open source in November 2009. It is a compiled language focused on productivity and concurrent programming, based on work done on the operating system called Inferno.

This is a simple case of how to execute a function in Golang with Docker Container.

### Start Server

```
-> go run hello.go
```

### Docker Hub

```
-> sudo docker run lucastelesdev/codeeducation
```
